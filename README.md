## Tech Stack
Hangry was built with React and powered by Firebase. It leverages the Firebase Firestore for realtime NoSQL document queries which allows for realtime notifications and restaurant swiping between two users. For animations we utilized react-spring and react-gestures. Further, all user data is securely handled using Firebase Authentication.

### Future Features
- Machine Learning recommendation system
- Track streaks between freinds
- Chat
