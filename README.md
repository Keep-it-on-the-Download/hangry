## Tech Stack

Hangry was built with React and powered by Firebase. It leverages the Firebase Firestore for real-time NoSQL document queries which allows for real-time notifications and restaurant swiping between two users. For animations we utilized react-spring and react-gestures. Further, all user data is securely handled using Firebase Authentication.

### Future Features

- Machine Learning recommendation system
- Track streaks between friends
- Chat
